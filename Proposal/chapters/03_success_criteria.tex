\section*{Success Criteria}

The project will be deemed a success if:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is possible to change the acceleration structure with minimal changes
  \item The performance of an acceleration structure can be measured
  \item The performance of the acceleration structures follow what is expected
  \item The implementations are performant to enable real-time rendering, where
    it applies
  \item Operations can be applied to the structures
  \item Scenes can be loaded to test the structures in various ways
\end{itemize}
