\section*{Success Criteria}

The core project will be deemed a success if:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Shaders are reloaded during runtime after the source file is modified
  \item The 5 acceleration structures, (3D grid, 3D texture, Octree,
    Contrees, Brickmaps) are implemented
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Structures can be used for ray-marching
      \item Structures can be modified
      \item Structures can be created during runtime from files
    \end{itemize}
  \item The used acceleration structure can be changed during runtime
  \item Metrics of the structures can be measured
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Memory consumption
      \item Render time
      \item GPU register pressure
      \item Intersection count
    \end{itemize}
  \item Voxel scenes can be generated from meshes via a separate script
  \item Scenes can be loaded and changed during runtime
\end{itemize}
