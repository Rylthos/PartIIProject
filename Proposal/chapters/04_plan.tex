By the end of Michaelmas the core project should be finished to a
sufficient degree. This leaves Lent to work on the more complicated extensions.
In particular lent will be focused on the split rendering, with an interest in
implementing the octree/contree as this structure, along with
selective inclusion
of the tree nodes that are out of level of detail range, and those that are
obscured would require more communication between the client and server, and so
a more interesting challenge.

There are also some additional tasks, that if time allows can be included.
Notably this may include better lighting calculations. These are not
planned for as the time requirement for
split rendering is not easy to judge. This is why the last sprint is left open,
either for additional tasks, or for continuing work on the previous tasks.
