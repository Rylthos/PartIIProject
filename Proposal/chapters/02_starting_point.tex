\section*{Starting Point}

Apart from the relevant courses (Introduction to graphics, Further
Graphics, AGIP),
previous work has been done in graphics and shader programming. In particular
work with vulkan and GLSL has been done before. Slang will need to be learnt,
however it appears to be similar to HLSL, which in itself is meant to be similar
to C\#, which I have prior knowledge in, and partially based off GLSL.
